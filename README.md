# Neovim

## Introduction

This repo hosts my Neovim configuration for Linux, macOS and Windows. The
`init.lua` file is the entry point for Neovim. You are encouraged to copy from
this repository the part you want and add it to your own configuration.

To reduce the posibility of breakage, **this configuration is only maintained
for the latest version of the Neovim HEAD branch. No effort is spent on 
maintaining backwards compaitibilty.
